1. Figure out dimentions for the game.

2. Figure out how to make obstacles move.

Goal : make a moving screen with moving obstacles.

Thoughts : make a ticking system???

write code to gen obstacles using a random number generator which will determine top obstacle - render it and determine bottom obstacle height after subtracting space needed for player to pass through. //printing each top/bottom obstacle n^2
